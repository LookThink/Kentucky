From sass.guidelin.es:

The layout/ folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebarâ€¦), the grid system or even CSS styles for all the forms.

    _grid.scss
    _header.scss
    _footer.scss
    _sidebar.scss
    _forms.scss
    _navigation.scss
